  2. It displays the specific day of the week which corresponds to a given date received by user input.
  3. A note can be added to a specific date .
  4. If a month is displayed through the function mentioned at the beginning, a specific date which includes an added note
     will be highlighted and the user will be given the option to display the note(s) of the specific month.
     
The different features can be accessed using the navigation menue which appears once the program is run.
